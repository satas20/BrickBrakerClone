# Brick Braker Clone
This project is made for the MASOMO game developer internship program. 
In my 7 weeks of training one of my tasks was to make a clone of the brick breaker game from this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg).
I made this project with Unity and C#. All the code and particles are created by me except sound fx.
The aim of this project is to see how polishing a simple game affects the game feel. While making the project I learned how important the game feel is. 

After compleeting the game I decided to make a mobile version of the clone but while turning it to a mobile game I wanted to change the game flow and come up with the idea of endless breakout game. I aim to keep the particles and visual effects but I keep some of them only. 2D arts are made by Tolga VarlÄ±. 
In this verison aim is to keeping the ball bouncing while avoiding the breaks to hit us. 



## How To Play
