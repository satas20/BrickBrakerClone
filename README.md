# Brick Braker Clone
This project is made for MASOMO game developer internship program. 
In my 7 week of training one of my tasks was to make a clone of the brick breaker game from this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg).
I made this project with Unity and C#. All the code and particles are created by me except sound fx.
Aim of this project is how polishing a simple game effects the game feel.While making the project I learned how important the game feel is. 


## How To Play
This is a clone of brick braker game. You can play the game with mouse. You try to break all the bricks without dropping the ball. 
You can adjust the balls bounce from the paddle  acording to the touch point of the ball on the paddle. The more it lands on the edges the more it bounce to that direction.
